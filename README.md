## getting started

You'll probably want to start with creating a virtual env.
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install all the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i
```

You'll need 2 console tabs to run the app.
```
# start the frontend
npm start

# start the backend
flask run --no-debugger
```

You'll be able to view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
